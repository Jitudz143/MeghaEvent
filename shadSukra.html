                        <p class="fs-5"> The CHAD SUKRA is a spring festival and in many cultures spring has been celebrated in accordance with the rites and rituals revolving around its importance in food production. In simple language spring is associated with the sowing of crops. During this time of the year all plants, including cultivated ones, begin growth anew after the dormancy of winter, it is a universal practice that spring season gave birth to something new in a way that the spring weather isn’t just a mood booster, it can actually change the way people think.</p>


                        <p class="fs-5">Chad Sukra is a community festival celebrated every year by the Pnar people of Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya. With the onset of winter and the arrival of spring the indigenous people embracing KA NIAMTRE religion is all set to prepare themselves for the sowing season. However it is the custom as practiced since time immemorial that tribute should be given to the mother earth KA BEI RYMAW as she is shielding us in her lap and feeds us for our survival as long as we are destined to live on the surface of the earth. </p>

                        <p class="fs-5">Hence KA CHAD SUKRA is a festival of the Pnar people of Jaintia Hills in the easternmost part of the Meghalaya state, celebrating the spirit of joyfulness and fraternity amongst the people, before all arrangements are made for the sowing season. It is also a season where people express their inner love to the divine power for all his affection, his care , his blessings which he had showered to humanity that the sweetness of life can always be savour and its beauty be enjoyed. It is an occasion where people express their gratitude to his glory that as the seasons rolled by the blessings of love continues on mankind, bringing a sparkle to life.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5">As practiced every year the theme for the celebration of ka Chad Sukra this year is “ A SYIEM MYNTDU TO KIT TO DA KAM KA HUKUM NADUH NACHWA”  it signifies the status of the river Myntdu as one of the guardian angel of Jowai town  </p>
                        <p class="fs-5">As Chad Sukra signals the arrival of spring, it also sends a strong message to the world that the sowing season is approaching and our farmers are all set to get started to their diverse agricultural activities. Chad Sukra also has a parallel sync with the onset of Ka Behdeinkhlam as it coincides with “KA DIH SOO PEN” – one of the rituals perform to kick start the beginning of this majestic festival along with “KA CHAT THOH”-marking the sowing season for the community. Ka Chad Sukra is an expression of the uniqueness of culture of the Pnar people and their dignified life, enhancing the richness of their cultural heritage, in an Indian land, with immense diversity.</p>
