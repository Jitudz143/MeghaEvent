                        <p class="fs-5">The Northeast of India has many ethnic groups and each is unique in character
                            with its own
                            distinct customs, language and dress. With a total of 7 states, Northeast India has many
                            unique festivals and they showcase in its brilliancy. Agriculture being the main source of
                            income, most of the festivals revolve around harvest which are celebrated with great pride
                            and joy. Wangala, a post-harvest festival of thanksgiving is celebrated in Meghalaya after
                            the completion of all agricultural activities.</p>


                        <p class="fs-5">Winter is the main harvest season in the Garo Hills of Western Meghalaya. A
                            traditional
                            three-day festival called the Hundred Drums Wangala is being held at A'DAM, Chibragre, West
                            Garo Hills, Meghalaya (the largest town in the Garo hills and the cultural capital of the
                            A’chik people) to celebrate the occasion. It is dedicated to ‘Misi Sanljong’ or ‘Pattigipa
                            Ra’rongipa’ that means God Sun. The people offer their gratitude in commemoration of the Sun
                            God for blessing them with an affluent yield throughout the year.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5">Garos are extremely attached to their culture and dress up in their finest
                            dokhmandas, their
                            traditional weaved festive attire donned with feathered headgears called 'Dome'. The three
                            days of cultural extravaganza consist of ‘Rugala’ and Sasat sowa rituals which are held on
                            the first day and Dama Gogata takes place on the final or last day of the festival. The
                            celebration of Rugala generally takes place in the house of the head of the village called
                            as ‘Nogma’ or a shed of Bamboo is constructed near the house. One day prior to this grand
                            carnival, the village chief Nogma performs rituals with fresh brewed beer called 'Chu',
                            cooked rice and vegetables that are offered to the god. Weaving of ‘Dokhmanda’ also takes
                            place.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">The major attraction of the festival is the music. The ceremony culminates in
                            merry-making
                            and dancing to the rhythmic beating of 100 drums and playing of other melodious indigenous
                            musical instruments. The 'orchestra' of men includes drums, gong and flutes, punctuated by
                            the sonorous music of a primitive flute made of buffalo horn. Several sports such as
                            climbing of oil-smeared bamboo poles are held and carrying of rocks is held. A fair is
                            organized in which weaves are sold along with local products and wooden materials.</p>
                        <p class="fs-5">There is no fixed time as such for the festival although it is generally
                            celebrated in the
                            month of November to signify the onset of winters and. The Wangala is also an occasion for
                            the government to spread awareness on health, crime and other issues by organizing plays and
                            music performances. The Meghalaya Government takes great interest to increase the flow of
                            tourist during the months of November and December and Wangala could be a great platform for
                            the same.</p>
