                        <p class="fs-5"> The biggest visual highlight of Shad Suk Mynsiem is the dance and accompanying music. The layout of the dancers can teach observant viewers a few things about the distinctive matrilineal societies that celebrate this occasion. The dance of the maidens reflects their roles in the community. They are in the middle – the keepers of the hearth, home, and the lineage of the clans. The turbaned men in ceremonial apparel are the protectors, they surround the female dancers armed with the waitlam (sword) and symphiah (whisk). The arrows in their quiver represent the qualities of a man. The role of the man in Hynniewtrep society is to be the advisor, leader, and protector – represented in the nuances of the Shad Suk Mynsiem rituals.</p>


                        <p class="fs-5">The female dancers are clad in the best silks, and adorned with gold, coral, and silver accessories. The crown represents dignity and modesty. Chastity of the dancer is represented by the lasubon flower, an important totem for the Hynniewtrep clans.</p>

                        <p class="fs-5">Visitors of the Shad Suk Mynsiem festival can also learn about Niam Khasi and the role of the Seng Khasi – an organization that keeping alive the old traditions and helping the indigenous beliefs and customs flourish into modern times. As the Khasis negotiate many cultural crossroads – this is one of the best ways to see the beautiful and ancient heritage, beliefs, and motifs of the community on one single stage..</p>

                        <p class="fs-5">As practiced every year the theme for the celebration of ka Chad Sukra this year is “ A SYIEM MYNTDU TO KIT TO DA KAM KA HUKUM NADUH NACHWA”  it signifies the status of the river Myntdu as one of the guardian angel of Jowai town  </p>
                        <p class="fs-5"> Both men and women participate in the dance where steps of women are subtle, whereas those of men are more energetic. Only unmarried (virgin) women participate in the dance, whereas there is no such restriction for men. The dance begins with drums, flutes and cymbals picking up the tempo. Two circles are formed with women on the inside and men on the outside. With eyes down, the women take small steps forward and backward as they gradually shift sideways to move in a circle. They keep their body straight and arms loose at shoulders. The men do a more energetic dance with swift movements in clockwise and anticlockwise direction around women. Men play a part of protectors for the women who are inside the outer circle. Ka Shad Suk Mynsiem dance is also symbolic of women fertility where they are receptacles of seeds and bearers of fruit, and men are cultivators who plant, cultivate and nurture the seeds until they are harvested.</p>
